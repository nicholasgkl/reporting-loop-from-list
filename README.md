# reporting-loop-from-list
This Macro cycles through a dropdown list, prints the reports generated (via the Index/Match function) for each entry as a pdf (with timestamp, form type and patient id as file name), and creates a new folder named "HealthHub Reports" if not already existing.

This was intended to improve clinic processes by automating the scoring and reporting process of screening questionnaires.
This was previously done manually (i.e., scan unscored paper forms and upload into patient electronic health record).

Please do note that that scoring instructions (i.e., excel formulas) for the questionnaire have been protected from view, as those are copyrighted by the publisher.
